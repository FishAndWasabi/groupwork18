This document is meant as a brief overview of some aspects of the new serial
driver.  It is not complete, any questions you have should be directed to
<rmk@arm.linux.org.uk>

The reference implementation is contained within serial_amba.c.
The reference implementation is contained within amba_pl011.c.




The serial core provides a few helper functions.  This includes identifingthe correct port structure (via uart_get_console) and decoding command line
arguments (uart_parse_options).

There is also a helper function (uart_write_console) which performs a
character by character write, translating newlines to CRLF sequences.
Driver writers are recommended to use this function rather than implementing
their own version.


Locking
-------

hardware.		- TIOCM_DTR	DTR signal.
		- TIOCM_OUT1	OUT1 signal.
		- TIOCM_OUT2	OUT2 signal.
		- TIOCM_LOOP	Set the port into loopback mode.
	If the appropriate bit is set, the signal should be driven
	active.  If the bit is clear, the signal should be driven
	inactive.

hardware.  enable_ms(port)
	Enable the modem status interrupts.

	This method may be called multiple times.  Modem status
	interrupts should be disabled when the shutdown method is
	called.

	Locking: port->lock taken.
	Interrupts: locally disabled.
	This call must not sleep

hardware.	state.  Enable the port for reception.  It should not activate
	RTS nor DTR; this will be done via a separate call to set_mctrl.

	This method will only be called when the port is initially opened.

	Locking: port_sem taken.
	Interrupts: globally disabled.


hardware.	RTS nor DTR; this will have already been done via a separate
	call to set_mctrl.

	Drivers must not access port->info once this call has completed.

	This method will only be called when there are no more users of
	this port.

	Locking: port_sem taken.
	Interrupts: caller dependent.
