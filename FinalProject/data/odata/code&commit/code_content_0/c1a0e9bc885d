config MIPS_COMPACT_BRANCHES_NEVER
	bool "Never (force delay slot branches)"
	help
	  Pass the -mcompact-branches=never flag to the compiler in order to
	  force it to always emit branches with delay slots, and make no use
	  of the compact branch instructions introduced by MIPSr6. This is
	  useful if you suspect there may be an issue with compact branches in
	  either the compiler or the CPU.

config MIPS_COMPACT_BRANCHES_OPTIMAL
	bool "Optimal (use where beneficial)"
	help
	  Pass the -mcompact-branches=optimal flag to the compiler in order for
	  it to make use of compact branch instructions where it deems them
	  beneficial, and use branches with delay slots elsewhere. This is the
	  default compiler behaviour, and should be used unless you have a
	  reason to choose otherwise.

config MIPS_COMPACT_BRANCHES_ALWAYS
	bool "Always (force compact branches)"
	help
	  Pass the -mcompact-branches=always flag to the compiler in order to
	  force it to always emit compact branches, making no use of branch
	  instructions with delay slots. This can result in more compact code
	  which may be beneficial in some scenarios.
